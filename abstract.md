## Guidelines
Research objective(s) – what was the purpose of the research project?
Research methods – how did you carry out the research?
Research outcomes (if known) – how has your research addressed a “problem” or issue of importance and what solution may have been found or identified?

## Abstract
The realm of multi-touch computing is generally restricted to experts. Current toolkits require a large amount of background knowledge in Java, C#, and various other technologies. Despite the fact that multi-touch user interfaces are increasingly more ubiquitous, they remain inaccessible to novices and typically require a large amount of development overhead. We’ve created the Simple Multi-Touch Toolkit for Processing, or SMT for short, to fix that.

SMT is a simple and flexible library for multi-touch user interface prototyping. It supports all major OSs and common input devices. It takes just a few minutes to install, and just a few more to learn the basic concepts. My personal contributions to SMT include refactored internals and API, improved visuals, some new pre-made UI elements, creation of a formal release process, a large amount of documentation, a suite of tutorials, as well as user support. We’ve completed an evaluation study of SMT, and are currently working on its analysis.

SMT is currently being used as a research aid and for teaching in multiple universities. Additionally, it has made touch computing accessible to students, artists, and hobbyists.
