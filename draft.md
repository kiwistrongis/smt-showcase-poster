## intro
The realm of multi-touch computing is generally restricted to experts. Current toolkits require a large amount of background knowledge in Java, C#, and various other technologies. Despite the fact that multi-touch user interfaces are increasingly more ubiquitous, they remain inaccessible to novices and typically require a large amount of development overhead. Weâ€™ve created the Simple Multi-Touch Toolkit for Processing, or SMT for short, to fix that.

SMT is a simple and flexible library for multi-touch user interface prototyping. It supports all major OSs and common input devices. It takes just a few minutes to install, and just a few more to learn the basic concepts. 


## teaching and research usage
SMT is currently being used as a research aid and for teaching human-computer interaction concepts in multiple universities. Additionally, it has made touch computing accessible to students, artists, and hobbyists.
